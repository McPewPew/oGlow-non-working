## oGlow 1.12   
  
Several of the modules use "hooksecurefunc" which wasn't implemented TBC, so these will not work without changes.  

oGlow.toc had been modified from it's TBC version, removing all modeules that use this function. 
I've added them back into the toc with leading hashes.

### Working  
character, inspect, bank  

### Untested, but potentially working
craft, mail

### Not working due to hooksecurefunc
bags, merchant, trade, tradeskill

### Untested  
gbank
